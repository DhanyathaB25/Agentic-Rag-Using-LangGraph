# Agentic-Rag-Using-LangGraph
Agentic-RAG-Using-LangGraph is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system implemented using LangGraph that follows an agentic workflow. The project demonstrates how multiple LLM agents collaborate using a graph-based execution model to route queries, retrieve context, generate answers, and validate outputs.
